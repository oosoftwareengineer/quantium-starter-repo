Task 1: Set Up Your Local Development Environment

Task Overview

What you'll learn
- Meet your clients Soul Foods who have seen a decline in sales on their top performing candy product
- How a software engineer at Quantium supports clients to understand the impact of their decisions on profitability

What you'll do
- Meet your supervisor Priscilla, a software engineer at Quantium in the financial services business area
- Set up your local development environment

Here is the background information on your task

With little more than a few requirements and a messy data set to reference, it’s time to take a swing at this project. While Quantium has a few core tech stacks they work with on a regular basis, a small interactive visualisation like this one is perfectly suited to the Dash framework. Dash is a Python framework for developing visual tools to interrogate data. It’s easy to use, quick to develop with, and results in a pretty finished product. Before you can get to work on the application itself, set up your local development environment for working with Dash. Your local development environment can be thought of as a workbench with all the tools necessary to progress on a project. Invest an adequate amount of time setting up a good workbench and development on any project will be made far easier.

Here is your task

To begin, get your hands on the starter repo - fork and clone it to your machine: https://github.com/vagabond-systems/quantium-starter-repo. If this step is confusing, read the first two chapters of the Git book linked below.
 
Open the project in your IDE of choice — feel free to use any Python IDE you’re comfortable with. If you don’t have a favourite Python IDE yet, look at Pycharm Community Edition. It’s a well-designed IDE by Jetbrains packed with features and plugins, powerful enough to work on the most complex projects, and entirely free.
 
One of the best ways to manage dependencies in Python is with virtual environments. Each virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and a collection of project dependencies. They are entirely encapsulated in a single folder, and easy to work with once you get the hang of them. For this project, you will set up a Python 3.9 virtual environment. Review the resources linked below for more information.
 
Next, add the dash and pandas packages as dependencies to your virtual environment. Instructions for this step can be found in the Resources section below.
 
With your virtual environment active, run `pip install "dash[testing]"` (without backticks) to install all the necessary dash testing dependencies.
 
Congratulations! You’ve completed the bulk of the work for this task and now have access to a fully-featured workbench. All that’s left is to submit your work. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub!

Estimated time for task completion: 30-60 minutes depending on your learning style.


Task 2: Data Processing

Task Overview

What you'll learn
- What data processing is and why it is important

What you'll do
- Meet your supervisor Liam, a software engineer at Quantium
- Perform some data processing to reorganise the data into a format that you can work with

Here is the background information on your task

In this task, you will become familiar with the art of data processing. Data processing is the esoteric practice of squishing data into a useful format. Data points themselves — raw quantities in isolation — are useless but become useful when arranged in thoughtful proximity with other data points. When done skilfully, a carefully organized corpus of data can be interrogated for useful information: answers to difficult questions, surprising insights which were initially hidden, and elusive trends which can quite literally be used to predict the future. There is an immense power buried in the sea of data collected with nonchalant regularity all around the world which can be harnessed if you choose to do so. The first step in the transmutation of data into information is a process affectionately referred to as “data processing”.

By way of illustration, Soul Foods has asked the question, “Were sales higher before or after the Pink Morsel price increase on the 15th of January, 2021?” Seems like a useful thing to know if you’re the one making those sorts of decisions. But all you have at your disposal are a few CSV files with a handful of seemingly random columns. Attempt to answer the question by simply looking at the available data. The answer isn’t very obvious, is it? Your task is to mould that raw material into something useful.

Here is your task

Soul Foods has provided you with three CSV files, all of which are in the data folder of the starter repo you cloned in the last task. These CSV files contain transaction data for Soul Foods’s entire morsel line. Each row indicates the quantity of a given type of morsel sold in a given region at a given price on a given day. Take a moment to acquaint yourself with the data contained in each one of these files.
 
Next, we’ll go field by field and think about how we can use each one:
The first field, “product”, contains many different types of morsels. Soul Foods is only interested in Pink Morsels, so we can remove any row which contains another type of product.
Next come “quantity” and “price”. Since we’re interested in the total sales for a given day, these can be combined into a single field, “sales,” by multiplying them together.
The date field is useful as is and can remain untouched.
It would be nice to filter by region in the final visualisation, so we’ll also leave the region field untouched.
 
Your task is to use the above instructions to convert the three CSV files into a single formatted output file. Your output file should contain three fields:
Sales
Date
Region

Task 3: Create a Dash Application

Task Overview

What you'll learn
- How a dataset can be visualised in a variety of different ways generating a variety of narratives

What you'll do
- Meet your supervisor Blaise, a data engineer at Quantium in the retail business area
- Create a Dash app to visualise data in an informative way that answers your client’s question

Here is the background information on your task

Data visualisation is just as much an art as a science. A particular dataset can be visualised in countless ways, many misleading, but some useful. Think of each visualisation as a different narrative governed by the same facts. By changing the narrative while leaving the facts unchanged, the facts can be made to convey an entirely different point. Here there be dragons. This is the power of data analysis — you have a dangerous amount of control over the point you convey. It’s up to you to derive that point from the data, rather than forcing the data to support a point it doesn’t actually fit.

In this case, we want to figure out what impact the price increase of Pink Morsels had on overall sales. Take a moment to think about different ways we could visualise the data to answer this question. Ideas? In the interest of creating something simple that simply works (usually a good idea, and an excellent opportunity to reinforce the KISS principle), you’ll be implementing a line chart. It may not be the most interesting visualisation in existence, but it will likely answer Soul Foods’s question with minimal embellishment to the dataset. In other words, we get a raw, unadulterated look at the data and let the data speak for itself.

Here is your task

Your task is to create a Dash app to visualise the data you generated in the last task. Lean on the resources linked below to learn more about the basics of working with Dash. Your application must incorporate the following elements:
A header which appropriately titles the visualiser
A line chart which visualises the sales data generated in the last task, sorted by date. Be sure to include appropriate axis labels for the chart.
 
Recall the original purpose of the Dash app you are building — the goal is to answer Soul Foods’s question: “Were sales higher before or after the Pink Morsel price increase on the 15th of January, 2021?” With the visualiser complete, the answer should be obvious. Congratulations, you just answered a pertinent business question using the awesome power of quantitative data. Soul Foods will be pleased to hear all about it!
 
When you are finished, commit and push your changes, then submit a link to your repo below!

Task 4: Improve Your Dash Application

Task Overview

What you'll learn
- Why it’s important and valuable to design a visually pleasing UI

What you'll do
- Add a radio button to make your app interactive
- Develop an intuitive UI that makes your Dash app visually impressive by applying some CSS to each element

Here is the background information on your task

Unsurprisingly, any good visualiser needs a visual component. The best data visualisers aren’t just useful but aesthetically pleasing as well. If you intend to work with data, do not underestimate the power of an intuitive, visually pleasing UI. Many data analysts overlook this component of their job, but you must remember that your app will be used by humans, not machines. By spending time on the look and feel of your visualiser, you’ll ensure that human users can navigate it intuitively and enjoyably. 

Think of it as showing affection to your visualiser, dressing it up before you put it on display for the world! To illustrate, look at this example from Dash: https://dash.gallery/dash-brain-viewer/. The developers who worked on this visualisation clearly thought about how people would interact with it and considered its visual appeal. The result is a visualiser that sucks you in — their data is fun to play with!

Here is your task

Soul Foods would like a way to dig into region-specific sales data for Pink Morsels. To this end, they’d like a radio button in your visualiser which allows them to filter sales data by region. Leaning on the resources linked below, add a radio button with five options to narrow which data appear in the line chart: “north,” “east,” “south,” “west,” and “all.”
 
Now it’s time to dress up your Dash app! Apply some CSS to each element to make your application more visually appealing. There are no requirements for this step other than that you put effort into making your visualiser interesting. The model answer contains an example styling, but the possibilities are infinite — make your visualiser your own!
